       At GreenCloset, we are dedicated to making a meaningful impact in low-income communities, where many individuals struggle to access basic necessities, including clothing. In the context of New York City colleges, where over 50% of students face financial challenges, we've developed a unique resourceâ€”an innovative mobile and web app that facilitates the easy exchange of clothing.

        <p className='aboutp2'>
        Our mission is to ensure that individuals always have clothes on their backs, especially for important occasions like first interviews and meetings. Through the power of giving, we are creating a supportive community where everyone can access the attire they need to succeed, bridging the gap for the countless low-income individuals who face clothing insecurity.
