## About GreenCloset:

GreenCloset is an innovative platform designed to tackle the dual challenge of student needs and textile waste. It's a community-driven solution that connects students who need professional attire with those who have clothes to donate. Our mission is to create a sustainable cycle of clothing reuse within the student community, reducing waste and promoting a supportive network.

ðŸ‘— **Sustainable Fashion Revolution**: GreenCloset is more than just a sharing platform; it's a movement towards a more sustainable and empathetic way of living.

ðŸ”„ **Circular Economy Model**: By encouraging clothing donations and exchanges, we're promoting a circular economy that benefits everyone involved.

ðŸŒŸ **Rewarding Generosity**: Donors receive points for their contributions, which can be redeemed for various campus services, adding an extra layer of incentive to participate.

## Time Spent:

Development time: **36** hours during a weekend hackathon

## Core Features

The following **core** features were implemented in GreenCloset:

## Challenges and Solutions:

During the development of GreenCloset, we encountered and overcame several challenges:

1. **User Authentication**: Implementing a secure and efficient user authentication system was crucial. We integrated OAuth for a streamlined login process.

2. **Data Synchronization**: Ensuring real-time updates across the user interface when new donations were made required a robust backend setup. We utilized Socket.IO for live data synchronization.

3. **Points System Logic**: Developing a fair and motivating points system involved complex logic. We crafted a balanced algorithm that encouraged continuous user engagement.

4. **Responsive Design**: Creating a mobile-responsive design was essential for accessibility. We employed a mobile-first approach using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

5. **Deployment Hurdles**: We faced challenges in deploying our full-stack application. By containerizing our app with Docker and hosting it on Heroku, we achieved a smooth deployment.
